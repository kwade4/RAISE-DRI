# Acknowledgements 

We are deeply grateful to the many individuals and organizations whose support, expertise, and engagement made RAISE-DRI possible.

First and foremost, we extend our deepest gratitude to the **Digital Research Alliance of Canada** for funding this project through the **DRI EDIA Champions Pilot Program**. Their finanical support and commitment to promoting equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility in Canada's research ecosystem allowed us to connect with researchers across the country. We also extend a special thanks to Ramses Von Zonn, whose training slides provided a valuable foundation for developing our instructional materials.

Our sincere appreciation goes to **Joyce Kao** and the **Open Life Science (OLS) Program** for their support, mentorship, and guidance. Their dedication to open science and community-building not only shaped our approach to designing inclusive and accessible training but also instilled in us a deeper commitment to collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Their guidance in project management and sustainable knowledge-sharing shaped both the vision and execution of this initiative, and helped bring RAISE-DRI to life.  

RAISE-DRI would not have been possible without the **181 researchers** from **23 institutions across Canada** who generously shared their experiences with digital research infrastructure through surveys. Your insights were invaluable in refining our training materials and ensuring they met the needs of the research community.

Finally, we extend our gratitude to the **93 participants** who attended our virtual and in-person workshops. Thanks to your engagement, we reached **108 equity-deserving researchers**, representing 56% of our total audience. Your participation was the heart of RAISE-DRI and was instrumental in helping us build a more inclusive and supportive digital research community.

# Case Studies

In this series of case studies, you will explore key concepts in machine learning and data science through hands-on examples using different datasets and platforms. 

## [Handwritten Digit Classification using ARC Resources]({% link mnist_cluster.md %})
✅ Learn how to work with the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.  
✅ Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.  
✅ Understand the advantages of using the Alliance's Advanced Research Computing (ARC) resources for training deep learning models.  

## [Handwritten Digit Classification using Google Colab]({% link mnist-colab.md %})
✅ Explore how to run and modify a machine learning notebook in Google Colab.  
✅ Learn to configure a runtime environment with T4 GPUs.  
✅ Compare and contrast Colab and the ARC resources in terms of ease of use, performance, scalabiity, and cost.   

## [Predicting Temperatures in Canadian Cities]({% link canadian-temps.md %})
✅ Analyze historical temperature data from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature dataset.   
✅ Use data visualization tools like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize temperature trends.  
✅ Implement a simple regression model to predict temperatures in Canadian cities and evaluate it's performance.

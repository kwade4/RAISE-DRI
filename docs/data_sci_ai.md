# Data Science and AI

Data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) involve analyzing large datasets and developing models to identify patterns, test hypotheses, and make predictions. These tasks often require significant computing power, especially when working with high-dimensional data or training complex models. High-performance computing (HPC) provides the speed and resources needed to process data efficiently and can reduce computation time from days to hours or even minutes. 

The Digital Research Alliance of Canada supports researchers by providing access to HPC systems, cloud computing, and data management tools. These resources make it possible to conduct large-scale analyses and tackle complex research questions that would be impractical on standard computers. By using ARC services, researchers can scale their work efficiently and accelerate the pace of discovery.

# Advanced Research Computing (ARC)

## Overview of ARC

Advanced Research Computing (ARC) is a cornerstone of Canada's digital research infrastrutcure and helps to support innovation across public and private sectors. It provides researchers with access to high-performance computing, advanced data storage, and data management tools. Advancements in ARC services including cloud computing, faster computer networking, and greater cybersecurity measures are transforming how research is conducted and helping researchers across Canada tackle increasingly complex challenges more efficiently.  

ARC is essential for solving complex problems that require signiificant computational power or massive amounts of data. From modelling climate change to exploring the human genome, ARC plays a role in handling time-sensitive and data-intensive reseach challenges. 

ARC is used by a wide range of individuals and organizations, spanning academia, industry, and government. Researchers from all disciplines, including science, engineering, health, humanities, and social sciences rely on ARC to tackles complex problems. Industry professionals in fields such as finance, artitifical intelligence (AI), and aerospace also leverage Canada's ATC infrastructure to drive innovation and solve real-world challenges. 

ARC fuels research across a variety of fields, such as: 
* **Health Sciences**: advancing disease treatments and discovery 
* **Astronomy**: exploring distant planets 
* **Ecology**: studying sea lice in farmed salmon 
* **Engineering and AI**: creating models to study protein-drug interactions  

ARC is used nationwide and is supported by 38 partner universities and institutions across Canada. 

ARC provides the computational power, storage, and data management services necessary for tackling complex, data-intensive research. It acclerates discovery, enhances research capacity, and supports a range of disciplines from health and environmental sciences to AI engineering. By equipping researchers with tools to tackle compelx problems efficiently, ARC helps drive innovation across academic and industrial settings and contriutes to advancements on a global scale.

## What is Advanced Research Computing 

Important terms: 
* **Research Computing**: whenever you're doing research that depends on a computer 
* **Advanced Research Computing**: when you're doing research and your own computer no longer suffices 
* **Supercomputing**: using a large, shared, custom system or cluster 
* **High-performance Computing (HPC)**: when speed of computation matters and you need parallel processing 

ARC is needed when
* your problem takes too long to run on your own computer 
* your problem is too big to run on your own computer 
* your data set is too big to run on your own computer 

ARC helps because it allows for more and faster computational power, more memory, and more data storage.

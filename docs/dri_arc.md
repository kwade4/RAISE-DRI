# Advanced Research Computing (ARC)

## Overview 
Advanced Research Computing (ARC) is a cornerstone of Canada's digital research infrastrutcure and supports innovation across public and private sectors. It provides researchers with access to **high-performance computing**, **advanced data storage**, and **data management tools**, enabling them to tackle complex and data-intensive challenges efficiently. 

## What is ARC? 
Advanced Research Computing (ARC) refers to the use of high-performance computing (HPC), supercomputing, and other specialized computational resources to tackle research problems that exceed the capabilities of a standard personal computer. ARC is essential for analyzing large datasets, running complex simulations, and performing computations that require significant processing power and memory.

### Key Terms 
* **Research Computing**: The use of computers to support research, including data analysis, simulations, and modeling.
* **Advanced Research Computing (ARC)**: When research demands exceed the capabilities of a standard desktop or laptop, requiring specialized computational resources.
* **Supercomputing**: The use of large-scale, high-performance computing systems designed for massive parallel processing and complex computations.
* **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: A type of ARC where computation speed is critical, and often leverages parallel processing across multiple processors or nodes.


### When is ARC Needed? 
You may require ARC resources if:

‚úÖ Your research problem **takes too long** to compute on a personal computer.

‚úÖ Your dataset is **too large** to process with local storage and memory.

‚úÖ Your simulations, models, or analyses **exceed the computational limits** of your personal computer.

### How Can ARC Help?
ARC helps to mitigate these challenges by offering: 

‚ö° Increased computational power ‚Üí Solve problems faster with access to large-scale processors.

üõ†Ô∏è Expand memory capacity ‚Üí Handle datasets and simulations that exceed personal system limits.

üíæ Enhance data storage ‚Üí Store and process massive datasets without hardware limitations.

## Why is ARC Important?
ARC is essential for solving complex problems that require signiificant **computational power** or **massive datasets**. It plays a key role in: 

‚úÖ **Accelerating Discovery**: Faster processing speeds allow researchers to run simulations, analyze large datasets, and test models efficiently.

‚úÖ **Handling Large-Scale Data** Advanced storage solutions make it possible to manage and process vast amounts of research data.

‚úÖ **Driving Innovation** ‚Äì ARC is used in both public and private sectors to develop new technologies and advance scientific understanding.

From modelling climate change to exploring the human genome, ARC plays a role in handling time-sensitive and data-intensive reseach challenges.

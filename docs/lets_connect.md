# Open Office Hours for Students and Researchers 

Getting started with coding, AI, or high-performance computing (HPC) can feel like a lot â€” there's so much to learn, and it's easy to feel stuck or unsure of where to begin. If you've ever thought, "*Where do I even start?*" or "*I wish I could ask someone who's been through this*," you're not alone.  

That's why we're hosting **free public office hours** â€” a low-pressure space where you can drop in, ask questions, or just chat about research. 

Whether you're new to Digital Research Insfrastructure (DRI) resources, troubleshooting your code, or exploring data science and AI, no question is too small â€” we're happy to help! ðŸ˜Š

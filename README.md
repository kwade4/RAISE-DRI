## About this Repository
Welcome to the RAISE-DRI project repository! 

<img src="https://github.com/kwade4/RAISE-DRI/blob/main/docs/assets/images/RAISE-DRI_logo_full.png" width="200">

RAISE-DRI (Research and AI at Scale using Digital Research Infrastructure Resources) is an initiative supported by the **Digital Research Alliance of Canada** (the Alliance) through the [DRI EDIA Champions Pilot Program](https://alliancecan.ca/en/funding-opportunities/dri-edia-champions-pilot-program). This project is committed to empowering equity-deserving researchers in Canada with the skills and knowledge needed to leverage the Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) for scalable and impactful research.  

RAISE-DRI offers hybrid workshops and self-guided tutorials covering a range of topics in artificial intelligence, data science, and high-performance computing, including: 
* Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Introduction to Data Science
* Fundamentals of Deep Learning
* Deep Learning (generative AI, LLMs, etc.)
* Introduction to High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Advanced Computing Resources (ARC)
* Strategies for Managing and Analyzing Ultra-High-Dimensional Data

These resources are designed to equip researchers with the knowledge and confidence to use the Alliance's DRI ecosystem in their work.

## About this Repository
This repository is part of a project funded by the **Digital Research Alliance of Canada** **(the Alliance)** through the [DRI EDIA Champions Pilot Program](https://alliancecan.ca/en/funding-opportunities/dri-edia-champions-pilot-program). This pilot program aims to increase awareness, access, and uptake of the Alliance's Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) among equity-deserving researchers in Canada. 

This project provides hybrid workshops and asynchronous self-guided tutorials covering a range of topics, including:
* Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
* Introduction to Data Science
* Fundamentals of Deep Learning
* Deep Learning (generative AI, LLMs, etc.)
* Introduction to High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Advanced Computing Resources (ARC)
* Strategies for Managing and Analyzing Ultra-High-Dimensional Data

These resources are designed to empower researchers with the skills and knowledge to harness the power of the Alliance's DRI resources for scalable and impactful research.
